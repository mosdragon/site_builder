# Background
I was enrolled in a seminar course titled *Learning with Limited Supervision* in *Fall 2019*, and each class a group of students would lead a discussion on a chosen paper. For my discussion, I chose the *Generative Adversarial Networks* by Ian Goodfellow.

I was tasked with not only presenting the methodology, but also debating the strengths of the paper against my colleague who presented the paper's weaknesses.

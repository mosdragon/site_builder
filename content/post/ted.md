In Fall 2018, I decided to apply to be a speaker for [TEDxGeorgiaTech](https://www.tedxgeorgiatech.com). I was chosen as one of the 6 speakers among 70 applicants.

For the 6 weeks that followed, I rewrote my speech several times over, memorized for hours at a time, and struggled to master hand gestures and vocal intonations.

Finally, on November 4th, 2018, my hard would paid. I was chosen to be the speaker that closed out the show. My speech, _Compounding Interest: How Instilling Drive Goes a Long Way_ tried to strike a delicate balance between being informative and being relatable. My focus was on the importance of instilling drive and the cascading effect that it had on educating society.

The full talk will be uploaded to YouTube, January 2018 [here](http://youtube.com).

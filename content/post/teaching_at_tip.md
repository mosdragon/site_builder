In Summer 2018, I became an Instructor for two courses offered by [Duke TIP](https://tip.duke.edu/):

- [Applications, Algorithms, Computers: Modern Programming](https://tip.duke.edu/programs/summer-studies/courses/applications-algorithms-computers-modern-programming-0) @ Rice University
- [Artificial Intelligence](https://tip.duke.edu/programs/summer-studies/courses/artificial-intelligence) @ Georgia Tech


Through this experience, I learned to design courses end-to-end, including crafting syllabi, conducting lectures, creating assignments, & engaging in parent-teacher conferences.

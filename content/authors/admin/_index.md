I recently complted my Master's degree in _Computational Science & Engineering_ at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Previously, I've also completed a Bachelor's degree in _Computer Science_ from Georgia Tech, with specializations in _Artificial Intelligence_ and _Devices_.

Over the years I've conducted research in multiple labs, served as a TA several times, and worked as a back-end software engineer. Here are some of my highlights:

- Head TA for Intro. to Artificial Intelligence @ GT - _Fall 2019_
- Research with [Social Dynamics and Wellbeing Lab](https://socweb.cc.gatech.edu/) -- _Summer 2019 - Present_
- Computer Vision Intern -- _Summer 2019_
- Research in 3D Object Detection -- _Fall 2018 - Spring 2019_
- Software Engineer -- _Summer 2017 to Summer 2018_
- Research in High Performance Computing -- _Fall 2016 - Spring 2017_
- Instructor for Artificial Intelligence for DukeTIP -- _Summer 2018_
- Delivered two TEDx talks on Mentorship -- _Fall 2018 - Spring 2019_
